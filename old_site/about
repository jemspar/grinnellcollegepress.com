<h2>Grinnell College Press is a student organization which works with writers and artists on campus to design and print (a collection of) their work in a cohesive and beautiful publication.</h2>

<p style="width: 75%; margin-left: 5%">We are now accepting submissions for the Spring 2019 group of publications! For shorter publications, please submit all the content you would like to publish. For larger collections of art, submit 8-10 samples from the collection, and for longer written works, submit 2-3 chapters or sections. If your submissions doesn't fall into any of those categories, please submit a detailed description of your idea or proposal.</p>
<p style="width: 75%; margin-left: 5%">The content of your submission need not be organized or completely publication-ready&mdash; we typically work with the authors/artists throughout the semester to formulate the design, layout, and possible illustration of their publications. If you do have any ideas about what you want the final published work to look like, please include that in your submission.</p>
<h2>Send your submissions to Press by <a href="mailto:press@grinnell.edu">email</a> or WeTransfer. <b>The Spring 2019 deadline is March 1.</b></h2>

<p style="width: 75%; margin-left: 5%">We are currently hiring new editors! Editors participate in the selection of 3-4 submissions for publication each semester, and then coordinate different parts of the editing, illustration, and design/layout process. <a href="mailto:press@grinnell.edu">Email</a> us with any experience in publishing, editing, or graphic design you have, though none is necessary.</p>
